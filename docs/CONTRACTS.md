# Frozen contracts

The interfaces that let the layers be built and changed independently. Small on purpose. When one
proves wrong, change it and repair the consumers — do not add a second way to do the same thing.

## `ITradingConnector` — `src/TradeAgent.ConnectorSdk/Contracts.cs`

Semantic trading operations, no platform detail. Reads, mutations, and an event surface.

Two things carry the safety of the whole system:

**`ConnectorCapabilities`** — what a backend can actually promise. `ReconciliationProvable` is
`SupportsClientOrderId && SupportsOrderHistory`. The gateway reads it to decide how much autonomy is
safe, and refuses `LIVE_AUTONOMOUS` when it is false. A connector must report this truthfully;
overstating it is the most dangerous lie a connector can tell.

**The exception distinction** —

| Throw | Meaning | Gateway's response |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectorRejectedException` | The broker definitively refused | `REJECTED`, final, nothing to reconcile |
| `ConnectorTransportException` | We do not know what happened | `UNKNOWN`, trading pauses, reconcile, **never resubmit** |

Any other exception is treated as indefinite. Getting these backwards is the one mistake that can
produce a live position nobody asked for.

## `IAgentRuntime` — `src/TradeAgent.AgentRuntime/IAgentRuntime.cs`

Detect · Install · Update · GetVersion · BeginAuthentication · GetAuthenticationState ·
CreateEnvironment · Start · Stop · Restart · ExecuteTask · GetHealth · Capabilities.

`CliAgentRuntime` implements all of it from a `RuntimeManifest`, so OpenCode, Codex and anything later
are the same code with different data. Runtime-specific awkwardness stays inside the manifest.

## Gateway IPC — `src/TradeAgent.Core/Protocol.cs`

Newline-delimited JSON over a named pipe, one object per line, 1 MiB cap.

```jsonc
// request
{"v":1,"id":"...","op":"buy","token":"...","session":"agent-...","request_id":"...","args":{...}}
// response
{"v":1,"id":"...","ok":true,"data":{...}}
{"v":1,"id":"...","ok":false,"error":{"code":"...","message":"...","user_message":"...","repair":"...","auto_repairable":false}}
```

- The first frame **must** be `hello` carrying the token. Anything else closes the connection.
- Reads and order operations only. Operator authority is not on this channel.
- `material-list` and `material-note` carry the workspace ledger. `material-note` is the only write on
  this channel that is not an order, and it writes to a table of **claims** — it cannot alter what the
  scanner observed, so it is not a route to editing the record of the agent's own work. A note whose
  hash matches nothing in the ledger is refused rather than stored.
- Every mutating op takes `request_id`. Reusing one returns the original outcome and dispatches nothing.
  **If it is omitted, the frame's own `id` is used in its place** — so the restriction below is
  enforced on whichever of the two is in effect, not on the optional field. (Until 2026-09-03 it was
  enforced on `request_id` alone, and omitting that field put an unrestricted wire string on a broker
  order: measured at 203 characters, with `#`, `/` and a space in it.)
- **The effective request id is restricted** (release-note fact, narrowed 2026-09-03): letters,
  digits and `-` only, 1-61 characters, and it may not begin with `op-`. It is carried onto the
  broker order as the client order id `TA-{request_id}`, which must therefore fit 64 characters;
  safety rule 1 needs that field to round-trip, so the shape is kept to what a broker is least
  likely to refuse. `op-` is reserved for the ids the gateway mints itself for `cancel-all` and
  `close-all` legs (`op-{nonce}-{intent}-{n}`), so an agent's id can never collide with one — a
  guarantee that holds only because the frame `id` is checked too. An effective id outside this is
  refused with `INVALID_REQUEST` rather than truncated.
  **The 64-character ceiling is a conservative guess: ATAS's real client-order-id limit is NOT
  VERIFIED and can only be settled on the Windows box.**
- `trade` prints `request-id: <id>` on stderr *before* sending, and includes `request_id` in `--json`.
  If a command dies without a reply, re-run it with the same `--request-id`; never with a new one.
- `trade schema --json` serves this contract at runtime, so an agent discovers capabilities instead of
  relying on a prompt that drifts.

## Bridge protocol — `src/TradeAgent.Connectors.Atas/BridgeProtocol.cs`

Compiled into both halves so the shapes cannot drift. TradeAgent hosts; the bridge dials in, sends
`hello` with its capabilities, then heartbeats. One payload field, `data`, in both directions. A
`bridge_protocol_version` mismatch is refused outright rather than half-trusted. `rejected: true` on a
failure frame is what marks a refusal definite.

## Order state machine — `src/TradeAgent.Core/OrderStateMachine.cs`

```
CREATED ──► AWAITING_APPROVAL ──► DISPATCHING ──► ACKNOWLEDGED ──► WORKING ──► PARTIALLY_FILLED ──► FILLED
                                       │                                              │
                                       ├──► REJECTED (terminal)                        └──► CANCEL_PENDING ──► CANCELLED
                                       │
                                       └──► UNKNOWN ──► RECONCILING ──► (whatever the broker actually says)
```

The rule the file exists to enforce: **nothing re-enters `DISPATCHING` from `UNKNOWN`.** That is the
transition a naive retry makes, and it is how a live account gets double-filled. `UNKNOWN` leaves only
through `RECONCILING`.

Ownership: whoever holds a request writes its outcome. The dispatcher owns `CREATED`,
`AWAITING_APPROVAL` and `DISPATCHING`; the reconciler owns `RECONCILING`; the connector's event stream
may only update requests neither of them currently holds. Both races this rule prevents were real
bugs found during the build.

**An approval is a dispatch decision, authorized at the moment it is made.** In `LIVE_CONFIRM` an
agent order is parked as `AWAITING_APPROVAL` after passing every gate and refused to the agent with
`APPROVAL_REQUIRED`. When a person presses Approve, the gateway makes the decision again from the
start, in this order:

1. the request must exist and still be `AWAITING_APPROVAL` — else `INVALID_REQUEST`;
2. its age must be inside the approval time-to-live — else `APPROVAL_EXPIRED`, below;
3. the mode must still be `LIVE_CONFIRM`, the mode it was proposed under — else
   `MODE_FORBIDS_EXECUTION`. `PAPER` and `LIVE_AUTONOMOUS` do allow the AI to trade; they are simply
   not the mode this order was parked under, and neither auto-dispatches it;
4. the authorization chain — kill switch, live activation, autonomy-needs-provable-state, an account
   chosen, no unreconciled work, a trustable health chain — run with **the AI's session, never the
   operator's**. The person is pressing the button but the ORDER is the AI's proposal, which is what
   makes the kill switch refuse an approval with `AI_TRADING_STOPPED`: re-enable, then approve, two
   deliberate acts;
5. the platform must still be the connector the record was parked on — else `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`. An
   account id is unique only *within* a platform, and switching platforms builds a new gateway over
   the same database, so a parked request outlives the platform it was proposed for; comparing
   account ids alone would send a simulator proposal to a real broker exposing the same id;
6. the chosen account must be the one the record names — else `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`, since the dispatch
   goes to the account on the record;
7. every risk limit: allowlist, quantity, paper-vs-real, rate limit, open positions, quote freshness
   for an order without its own price, and order value multiplied by contract size.

Only then does it dispatch. A refusal at any step leaves the record `AWAITING_APPROVAL` for a person
to decline deliberately — except step 2. A request as old as or older than the approval time-to-live
(`GatewayOptions.ApprovalTtl`, 15 minutes by default) is refused with `APPROVAL_EXPIRED` and declined
through the state machine: `AWAITING_APPROVAL → CANCELLED`, `last_error` saying so. The bound is
inclusive, so `ApprovalTtl = 0` expires everything; and an age that cannot be trusted — a record
timestamped in the future, after a clock step or a restore — expires on the same rule rather than
staying approvable forever. Age is judged before every gate that follows it, so a request that is
both expired and refusable for some other reason is declined rather than left parked behind a refusal
the person could lift and then walk straight back into. **Nothing sweeps:** expiry is evaluated only
when a person presses Approve, so a request can be past the limit and still listed as awaiting
approval — which is why the Dashboard row states the time it stops being approvable. An agent
replaying that request id gets whatever the record now says, and proposes again with a new id if it
comes back `CANCELLED` and it still wants the order.

## Health and errors

`HealthState`: `UNKNOWN · STARTING · READY · DEGRADED · FAILED · PAUSED`, per component.
`HealthRegistry.ExecutionTrustable` requires Gateway, Trading connection, Account and Execution
capability all `READY`; anything else revokes trading rather than guessing.

`ErrorCode` → `ErrorInfo` gives every failure a technical detail, a plain-language explanation, a
suggested repair, and whether TradeAgent can fix it itself. A unit test asserts every code has all
four, so a raw exception can never become the user's primary guidance.

## Onboarding

`OnboardingStep` in order, progress in the database. `Current()` is the first unfinished step, which is
what makes setup resumable after a crash, an ATAS restart or a Windows restart. Steps the software can
verify never ask the user to confirm they did them.
